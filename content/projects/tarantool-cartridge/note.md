Subject: Tarantool Cartridge

[https://www.tarantool.io/cartridge](https://www.tarantool.io/cartridge) is an open-source framework
that helps developers write distributed apps in Tarantool. It is one of the building blocks of Tarantool
Data Grid. We decided to open source Cartridge to standardize app development between community and 
enterprise versions of Tarantool.
