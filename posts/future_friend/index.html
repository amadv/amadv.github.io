      <h1>Make friends with the future you</h1>
<p>When you look around, you are looking at a series of decisions that you have made over the course of your life.</p>
<h2>Do you like what you see?</h2>
<p>The place that you live, the car that you drive, your physical appearance, how much money you have in your account; they all are a direct tie to the decisions you have made months, years, or perhaps even decades ago.</p>
<p>That’s unbelievably powerful.</p>
<p>When you make a decision in the here and now, you have to look at how it will impact Future You. You have to understand that all we have is this moment, but the choices that we make in this moment will impact our future moments.</p>
<p>So, when you decide to eat junk food, think about what Future You would say.</p>
<p>When you spend frivolously on things that you don’t actually need, what would Future You say?</p>
<p>What would Future You say about the casual hookups that destroy the soul? What would Future You say about the skipping out on a workout? What would Future You say about not taking time to learn that skill? What would Future You say about not saying hello to that person that might be able to help you? What would Future You say about procrastinating?</p>
<h3>Because one day, you will meet him.</h3>
